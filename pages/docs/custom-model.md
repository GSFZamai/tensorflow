## Lesson summary

In this lesson, we'll use TensorFlow.js to **create an image classification model from scratch**!!

We'll create our own training data, we'll transform it to the correct format, we'll talk about layers, we'll train and test our model and we'll use it in the browser to create a working image classification web application. ðŸŽ‰

Here's a little preview demo:
