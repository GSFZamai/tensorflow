If you've gone through the rest of the workshop, you should be able to implement the basics of machine learning in JavaScript with pre-trained model, augment them with transfer learning and even build your own model!

Now, in the bonus section, I want to share some cool things you can do as a JavaScript developer dabbling into machine learning.

## Examples

- Eye blink detection with the Notion brain sensor
- Motion detection street fighter with phone / Arduino
